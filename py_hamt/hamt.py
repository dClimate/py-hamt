    For writing, this HAMT is async safe but NOT thread safe. Only write in an async event loop within the same thread.

    When in read-only mode, the HAMT is both async and thread safe.

    #### A note about memory management, read+write and read-only modes
    The HAMT can be in either read+write mode or read-only mode. For either of these modes, the HAMT has some internal performance optimizations.

    Note that in read+write, the real root node id IS NOT VALID. You should call `make_read_only()` to convert to read only mode and then read `root_node_id`.

    These optimizations also trade off performance for memory use. Use `cache_size` to monitor the approximate memory usage. Be warned that for large key-value mapping sets this may take a bit to run. Use `cache_vacate` if you are over your memory limits.

    #### IPFS HAMT Sample Code
    ```python
    kubo_cas = KuboCAS() # connects to a local kubo node with the default endpoints
    hamt = await HAMT.build(cas=kubo_cas)
    await hamt.set("foo", "bar")
